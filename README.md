## User story
AS A person who is traveling,
I WANT to find an easy-to-use website that will show me the exhange rate for some money without too many buttons or confusing UI elements,
SO THAT I can see how much the money that I have is worth in another country.


GIVEN a website that will give me the exchange rate,

WHEN I choose 2 particular countries,
THEN I am shown the exchange rate between them.
